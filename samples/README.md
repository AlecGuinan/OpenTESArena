## Samples

These images are from my test project I did around the middle of January 2016 to demonstrate what the world might end up looking like with a simple ray tracer as the graphics engine.

OpenTESArena doesn't have all of that functionality yet because the original sprite code is too naive (i.e., for each ray, try to intersect all sprites), and I am in the process of redesigning it.

Later on, I would like to add more effects like soft shadows, etc. once the rendering pipeline is more efficient.
