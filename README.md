# OpenTESArena

This project plans to be an open-source remake of the original "The Elder Scrolls I: Arena" game by Bethesda Softworks. It currently uses the MIT license and is planned to be written in C++/SDL2. This project is still very early in development, and there is currently only one programmer (myself) working on it. Plans have been built up over the past few months and just recently has it started progressing through the early stages.

The original art and music may be included with project releases since the game was made freely available by Bethesda upon its 10th anniversary in March 2004. Those content files were extracted from the game data and eventually converted into common formats like PNG, MIDI, and WAV thanks to the WinArena project, and others Arena tools.

The graphics engine is planned to be a ray tracer written with the OpenCL framework. A number of sample images showcasing the current state of the ray tracer are available in the "samples" folder.
